# UltOS - Ultimate Operating System

UltOS is a work-in-progress graphical operating system for the Commodore compatible
Ultimate 64 and UII+ cartridges developed by Gideon Zweijtzer, intended to take advantage
of the machines native feature set.

It will currently run on a standard C64 with 17xx REU and 1351 mouse.

To compile the source:

Requires latest version of 64TASS. On a Windows machine, just run the build.bat script.  Ill work on a make file
for other operating systems soon.

The current d64 image is in the target directory.

# UOS - Ultimate Operating System

UOS is a work-in-progress graphical operating system for the Commodore compatible
Ultimate 64 and UII+ cartridges developed by Gideon Zweijtzer, intended to take advantage
of the machines native feature set.

To compile the source:

On a Windows machine, just run the build.bat script.  Ill work on a make file
for other operating systems soon.

Current builds are in the directory also.
